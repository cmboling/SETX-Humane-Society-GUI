ReadMe.txt for TUI

Command Prompt method:

All classes have been compiled and successfully executed before project presentation.
Please be noted of this!

Also, the compilation may experience errors due to path location names in the code.
Please change these instances to get a successful run.

To compile, locate the folder Humane_Society.
Then type "cd TUI"

Since our TUI is ran a certain way on command prompt (rather than Eclipse IDE),
please compile HumaneSocietyApp.java to be assured that the class does indeed run.

To do this type "javac  HumaneSocietyApp.java"

If successfully ran, please type "java  HumaneSocietyApp" to run the program.

Then, the TUI is free to use at your own expense.
