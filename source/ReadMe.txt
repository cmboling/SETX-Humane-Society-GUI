ReadMe.txt for GUI

Command Prompt method:

All classes have been compiled and successfully executed before project presentation.
Please be noted of this!

To compile, locate the folder Humane_Society.
Then type "cd GUI"

Since our GUI is ran a certain way on command prompt (rather than Eclipse IDE),
please compile InformationUI.java to be assured that the class does indeed run.

To do this type "javac InformationUI.java"

If successfully ran, please type "java InformationUI" to run the program.

Then, the GUI is free to use at your own expense.
