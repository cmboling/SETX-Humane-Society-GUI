Neutering/Spaying services:

	Many owners wait till their pet is at least 6 months till they think of neutering. This is not always a wise decision, because 
though this varies animals can have litters as soon as 4 months.  Humane societies have partnered with whentospay.org to help promote 
information for people who are uninformed.

4 months:
a. Although this varies from animal to animal, Cats can get pregnant as soon as 4 months
b. Also cats can become pregnant again while they are still nursing their litters, and can have up to three litters a year with four kittens 
    pre litter
c. Dogs generally are 5 to 6 months old before their first heat 
d. Dogs normally have about two litters pre year with an average of four puppies a litter.

Accidently pregnancies:
a. About 50% of pregnancies are accidental
b. in heat most animals will go to extremes to mate
c. Even if you are as careful as possible there is still a strong chance of your animal getting pregnant

Shelter Overcrowding:
a. Overbreeding leads to an excess of animals
b. millions of animals are put in shelter each year, up to 75% of animals have to be put down to make room for these new incoming animals.

Neutering/Spaying at an early age is safe:
a. Yes, this is a safe process for animals even at an early age
b. This will also help keep animals from extreme behavior as they will not experience heat as strongly as non-neutered animals do.
c. Puppies and kittens recover faster than adult cats and dogs do 
So visit your local animal shelter and check for neutering services and times
