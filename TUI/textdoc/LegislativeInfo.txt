Legislative information:
	As the HSUS has released the 2013 state ranking scale, which is a comprehensive collection of all 50 states dealing with a wide 
range of animal protection laws that have been passed or are being put to vote. In this current report Texas has received a 40% score, having
passed 31 laws out of 77 from animal fighting to horse protection. 
	The most current win for animal rights is against puppy mills in pet stores. There was a major loop hole for people that could 
receive a license saying they were a “pet store” and using poor cage areas and mistreat of animals to mass produce a stock of goods to sell 
to wanting costumes. Most costumers were through online purchases and did not see the condition of the animals however. As of 
September 12th 2013 that loop hole is finally closed giving animal’s freedom and hopefully a happy home.
