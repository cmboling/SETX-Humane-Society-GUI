Promoting National Spirit of Adopting Pets:

Annual Community Outreach 
Each year the Humane Society of Lamar hosts an information event to provide direct 
benefit to pet owners. Past events have included: low cost vaccinations and low cost micro-chipping.

Community Fundraising
Each year you will find the Humane Society of Lamar at events in the community throughout the year. 
Volunteers are critically involved in attending these events and taking adoptable animals out to
public venues to increase their chances of finding a permanent loving home. 
You will find us at PetSmart and at other Southeast Texas businesses participating in fund-raising efforts.
	
Lamar Pet Therapy
Humane Society volunteers, accompanied by a variety of small animals, make regular visits to 
nursing homes and convalescent centers in Southeast Texas. This "hands on" activity brings joy to
our community each year by providing them with the opportunity to cuddle a furry kitten or puppy.
