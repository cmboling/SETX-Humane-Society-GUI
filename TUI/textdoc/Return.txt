Returning your pet:

The Humane Society of Lamar cannot accept every animal brought to our shelter immediately. 
We respect the difficult decision of owners to relinquish their pets, and the hard choices of those 
good citizens who are trying to help a stray. We accept the surrender of pets as space allows. 
We maintain a waiting list for all animals needing to be admitted to the shelter.
Animals are surrendered to our facility by appointment.
We admit at least 12 animals per week. We accept more animals as adoptions and space allow.
Note that we cannot accept aggressive, sick or pregnant animals.
Please call 409-225-7981, and one of our adoption specialists will speak to you.
At times our waiting list will have up to 100 animals waiting for admission and it can take several weeks 
before we can admit your pet.
Please understand that our primary goal is to place as many animals in forever homes as possible, 
therefore we must give every pet admitted to the shelter enough time to find a loving home. 
We cannot guarantee placement of every animal admitted to the shelter.
	
Admission of any animal into the Humane Society of Lamar  is based on the animal’s health, 
behavior, and adoptability. When you bring your pets, please have:

    *Any veterinary records
    *Your pet’s medications
    *Special food or treats that your pet needs
    *Your pet’s bed, toys, leash and other belongings from home

A staff member will evaluate the temperament of your pet. Once your pet has been screened, 
and the Humane Society of Lamar decides to accept your pet, we ask a donation to our shelter to be made. 
This is not required, but will greatly help us care for your pet.
